# Overview

Welcome to the Authentication Service of the Flight Management System backend project. This service is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization within the airline system. It utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization and ensures that passwords are securely encrypted to comply with security standards.

# Features

- User Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves using their credentials.
- JWT Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, JWT tokens are generated for authorized access to protected resources.
- Password Encryption: User passwords are securely encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Token Validation: JWT tokens are validated to ensure the authenticity and integrity of requests.
